Nova
====

Nova plugins are plugins designed specifically for auditing the compliance and security level
of an existing system. These plugins are designed to alow an administrator to
run security checks or even groups of security checks within their SaltStack
installation. This allows for real-time insight into the compliance level of
running systems.
